    <string name="vegetarian_food">
        A vegetarian is someone who doesn\'t eat meat, and mostly
        eats foods that come from plants, like grains, fruits, vegetables,
        and nuts. Some stricter vegetarians avoid more than just meat.
        They also avoid animal products, which are nonmeat foods that come from animals.
        Some examples would be milk (from cows) and eggs (from chickens). </string>
